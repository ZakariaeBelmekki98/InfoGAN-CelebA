# InfoGAN-CelebA

This repo contains an implementation of InfoGAN from the paper InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657). The model is implemented in PyTorch.

The model succeeds in learning salient features like pose and hair color. Below is an example of samples after varying the code for hair color.
